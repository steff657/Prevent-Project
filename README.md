## Design & Planning

### User Stories

| User Role | Goal | Benefit |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Visitor** | I want to clearly understand what the "Prevent" strategy is. | So that I can understand its role in community safety. |
| **Concerned Citizen** | I want to recognize the signs of radicalisation. | So that I can identify if someone I know needs help. |
| **Reporter** | I want to find the specific contact details for my local council. | So that I can report a concern to the correct authority quickly. |
| **Mobile User** | I want to access the site on my phone. | So that I can look up information while away from a computer. |
| **Visually Impaired User** | I want the site to use high-contrast colours. | To ensure the text is legible and accessible. |

### Wireframes

### Typography
The project uses **'Space Mono'** from Google Fonts.
* This font was chosen to match the Cyberpunk aesthetic chosen during the design phase.
* It is a monospaced font that provides a technical, data-driven look while remaining legible.
* Fallbacks include 'Consolas' and standard sans-serif fonts.

### Colour Scheme
The design follows a "Neon Cyberpunk" high-contrast theme:
* **Background:** Dark Navy/Black (`#0A0A1A`)
* **Primary Text:** Silver/Light Grey (`#C0C0C0`)
* **Accents:** Neon Blue (`#00FFFF`), Neon Pink (`#FF00FF`), and Neon Green (`#39FF14`).

## Features

### Navigation
* A responsive Bootstrap navigation bar that is fixed to the top of the viewport.
* On mobile devices, it collapses into a hamburger menu.
* Links provide smooth scrolling to specific sections of the page.

### Home Page / Hero Section
* Features a high-impact title and introductory text explaining the core objective.
* Includes a relevant image with a custom neon border effect.

### Understanding Extremism (Carousel)
* An interactive image carousel that cycles through images created around three key pillars: Community Safety, Online Awareness, and Reporting Concerns.

### Information Sections
* **What is Prevent:** A two-column layout explaining the safeguarding aims.
* **Recognising Risks:** A detailed breakdown of warning signs (Behavioural, Emotional, Online, Political) using custom styled lists.

### Geolocation Tool
* **"Find My Local Prevent Team"**: A JavaScript-powered feature.
* Uses the **Geolocation API** to get the user's coordinates.
* Fetches data from the **OpenStreetMap (Nominatim) API** to determine the user's city/town.
* Automatically redirects the user to their specific local council's Prevent page if a match is found in the database.

### Contact Form
* A user-friendly form for general inquiries.
* Includes validation to ensure fields are not left empty.
* Triggers a custom Bootstrap **Modal** upon successful submission to confirm the message was "transmitted."

### Footer
* Simple placeholder copyright information styled to match the neon theme.

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs
1.  **Geolocation Redirect Issue:** Initially, the geolocation function would try to redirect even if no city match was found.
    * *Fix:* Added logic to check if `targetUrl` exists. If not, it displays a warning message to the user instead of attempting to redirect.
2.  **Navbar Overlap:** The fixed navbar was covering the top of section headings when clicking links.
    * *Fix:* Added `padding-top: 80px` to the `body` and configured scroll-padding in CSS.

### Known Issues
* The Geolocation tool relies on specific spelling of city names returned by OpenStreetMap. Some areas might not match the hardcoded `councilData` object list yet.
* Formatting errors shown when testing with dev tools for older devices and devices with small screens but when tested with an android devices there were no issues found, possible browser issue.
